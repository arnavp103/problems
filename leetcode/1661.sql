-- There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes.
-- Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
-- The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp.
-- The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
-- The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

-- cast to numeric to avoid error
