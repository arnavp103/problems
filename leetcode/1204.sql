-- There is a queue of people waiting to board a bus.
-- However, the bus has a weight limit of 1000 kilograms, so there may be some people who cannot board.

-- Write a solution to find the person_name of the last person that can fit on the bus without exceeding the weight limit.
-- The test cases are generated such that the first person does not exceed the weight limit.

select person_name
from (
	select
		person_name,
		sum(weight) over (order by turn) as total_weight
	from Queue
)
where total_weight <= 1000
