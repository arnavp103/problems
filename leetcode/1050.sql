-- 1050 Actors and Directors Who Cooperated At Least Three Times

Create table If Not Exists ActorDirector (actor_id int, director_id int, timestamp int)
Truncate table ActorDirector
insert into ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) values ('1', '1', '0')
insert into ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) values ('1', '1', '1')
insert into ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) values ('1', '1', '2')
insert into ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) values ('1', '2', '3')
insert into ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) values ('1', '2', '4')
insert into ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) values ('2', '1', '5')
insert into ActorDirector (actor_id, director_id, timestamp) values ('2', '1', '6')

-- Write a solution to find all the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times.

select actor_id, director_id
from ActorDirector
group by actor_id, director_id
having count(*) >= 3;
